# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Using-CNN
- The handwritten digit recognition uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.
- We will use the MNIST dataset
- We have used CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) model which is a type of Deep Learning.
- We will build a GUI in which you can draw the digit and recognize it
## About the Dataset
- The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing.
- The MNIST dataset has 10 different classes
- The handwritten digits images are represented as a 28Ã—28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.
## Model
1. Import necessary libraries
   First, we are going to import all the modules that we are going to need for training our model.
