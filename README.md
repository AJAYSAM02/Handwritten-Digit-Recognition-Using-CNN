# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Using-CNN
- The handwritten digit recognition uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.
- We will use the MNIST dataset
- We have used CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) model which is a type of Deep Learning.
- We will build a GUI in which you can draw the digit and recognize it
